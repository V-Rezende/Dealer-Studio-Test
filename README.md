## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to build and deploy a responsive, component-based React website without using any UI libraries. The focus was on creating reusable components and implementing state management to showcase interactivity and attention to design details.

## Demo

You can view the live demo here: [Dealer Studio Test](https://v-rezende.github.io/Dealer-Studio-Test/)

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile, with a single-card row display on mobile.
- **Custom Components**: Card layout built from reusable components (Card, CardImage, CardHeader, CardBody, Button) with no external libraries.
- **Interactive State Management**: On load, the middle card is highlighted with a border. Clicking on a card's button switches the border to that card, while always starting with the middle card highlighted on initial load.
- **Styling and Icons**: Custom styles with SCSS for a polished look, including padding, box shadow, border radius, and alignment. Icons add visual interest.

## Technologies Used

- **React** - Component-based JavaScript library for building the UI.
- **SCSS** - For styling to take advantage of variables, nesting, and modularization.
- **GitHub Pages** - Deployed for easy access and sharing.
